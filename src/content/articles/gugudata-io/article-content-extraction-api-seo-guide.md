Search teams, content platforms, and data products often start with the same messy input: a public article URL. The page may include navigation, cookie banners, related posts, comments, scripts, and layout HTML. What you usually need for an SEO workflow is much smaller and much more structured: the article title, description, readable body, plain text, main image, image candidates, author, published time, and source domain.

The [GuGuData Article Content Extraction API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontent) is designed for that exact job. It extracts clean article content from a public webpage URL and returns a normalized JSON response that can be stored, indexed, summarized, compared, or passed into downstream SEO automation.

This guide explains where the API fits in an SEO stack, how to call it, what fields to expect, and how to combine it with related GuGuData website tools.

## Why article extraction matters for SEO

Modern SEO work is not only about ranking pages. Teams also need to monitor competitors, build internal content intelligence, analyze topic coverage, enrich editorial workflows, and turn public pages into structured records.

Article extraction helps with:

- Content inventory: collect clean text from a list of article URLs.
- Topic analysis: compare titles, headings, body text, and summaries across competing pages.
- Search result enrichment: store article metadata for discovery, tagging, and indexing.
- AI workflows: send readable article text to summarization, classification, or content QA steps.
- Internal linking research: combine extracted text with link extraction and search visibility data.
- Publishing operations: normalize articles before archiving, review, translation, or reporting.

The key point is consistency. If your pipeline stores raw HTML from every page, every downstream step has to deal with layout noise. If your pipeline stores a clean article record, later analysis becomes much easier.

## SEO workflows you can build

### 1. Competitor content monitoring

Store a list of competitor article URLs, extract each page on a schedule, and compare changes in title, description, body length, image usage, and publication freshness. This is useful for tracking fast-moving topics where search results change weekly.

A practical database record can include:

- Original URL
- Extracted title
- Extracted description
- Word count from `contentText`
- Primary image
- Author and published time
- Last extraction time
- Hash of the extracted body for change detection

Once content is normalized, you can build alerts for newly published content, title changes, or unusually long and short articles in a target topic cluster.

### 2. Topic coverage and content gap analysis

For a content gap workflow, extract the top pages for a query, then compare their body text against your own content. The goal is not to copy text. The goal is to understand which concepts, subtopics, and entities appear repeatedly across ranking pages.

The Article Content Extraction API gives you the clean `contentText` needed for:

- Topic clustering
- Entity extraction
- Summary generation
- Heading and paragraph analysis
- Content depth comparison
- Editorial briefs

Pair this with [Search Visibility API](https://gugudata.io/details/search-visibility) when you also need to understand how visible a URL or query group is in search.

### 3. AI and knowledge-base ingestion

Large language model workflows perform better when the input text is clean. Instead of sending full page HTML into an AI step, extract the article first and pass `title`, `description`, and `contentText` into your prompt.

For example:

```json
{
  "title": "Example article title",
  "description": "A short page description",
  "contentText": "Readable article body..."
}
```

This helps reduce prompt noise, avoids navigation text, and makes outputs easier to audit.

### 4. Editorial QA

Content teams can use extracted article records to check whether a published page has the expected title, description, author, publish date, and hero image. That makes the API useful not only for external research, but also for internal publishing checks.

Common QA checks include:

- Missing title
- Missing meta description
- Missing primary image
- Very short body text
- Missing author
- Missing publication date
- Page content changed after approval

## Choosing between related URL APIs

GuGuData has several URL-focused website tools. Use the extraction endpoint that matches your output.

| Need | Recommended API |
| --- | --- |
| Clean article metadata and body text | [Article Content Extraction API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontent) |
| Article image candidates only | [Extract Images from Article URL API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontentimages) |
| Page converted to Markdown | [Convert URL to Markdown](https://gugudata.io/details/url2markdown) |
| Prompt-based structured fields | [Extract Structured JSON from Webpage](https://gugudata.io/details/url2json) |
| Browser-rendered HTML | [Fetch Rendered HTML from URL](https://gugudata.io/details/url2html) |
| Page screenshot or visual QA | [Webpage Screenshot Capture](https://gugudata.io/details/url2snapshot) |
| Technical SEO scoring | [PageSpeed and SEO Score API](https://gugudata.io/details/pagespeed-score) |

Use Article Content Extraction when the source is an article and the target is a reusable content record. Use URL to Markdown when the result will be read by humans or stored in documentation. Use URL to JSON when your use case needs custom fields that are not fixed in the article parser response.

## Implementation notes

- Validate URLs before sending them to the API.
- Store both the source URL and extraction timestamp.
- Do not assume every public URL is an article. Some pages may return limited content.
- Keep retries conservative because external sites can be slow or temporarily unavailable.
- Store `contentText` for search and analysis, and store `content` only when your workflow needs readable HTML.
- Use `images` for downstream media analysis, but choose `image` when you only need the primary candidate.
- Keep `appkey` on the backend. Do not expose it in browser-side code.

## HTTP status handling

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Article content extracted. | Parse `data` and store the fields your workflow needs. |
| `400` | Missing or invalid URL. | Validate URL format and request body. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Check your `appkey`. |
| `403` | Access or payment issue. | Check subscription and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Rate limit reached. | Reduce concurrency or retry later. |
| `503` | Target page or extraction service unavailable. | Retry later and keep the failed URL for review. |

## FAQ

### Is this a crawler?

No. This endpoint extracts content from a URL you provide. Your application should still manage its own URL list, queue, scheduling, and retry rules.

### Can I use it for every page on a site?

Use it for article-like pages where title, body text, metadata, and image candidates matter. For broad site audits, combine it with URL discovery, link extraction, and technical SEO checks.

### Does it return both HTML and text?

Yes. `content` provides readable article HTML, while `contentText` provides plain text for search, indexing, classification, or AI workflows.

### How is this different from URL to Markdown?

Article Content Extraction returns a structured article object. URL to Markdown returns a Markdown representation of the page. Use the article API for structured data and URL to Markdown for portable readable documents.
