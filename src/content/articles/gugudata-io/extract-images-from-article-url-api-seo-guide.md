Images are part of the SEO record of an article. They influence visual presentation, social previews, content quality checks, media reuse, image search opportunities, and editorial QA. But extracting the right images from an article page can be harder than it looks. A public webpage often includes logos, avatars, icons, ads, tracking pixels, recommendations, and unrelated layout images.

The [GuGuData Extract Images from Article URL API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontentimages) focuses on image candidates from the readable article area. It returns normalized image URLs with alt text and available width and height attributes, making it useful for SEO image audits, content ingestion, and media workflows.

This guide explains how to use the API, how to evaluate image results, and where it fits with other GuGuData web extraction APIs.

## Why article image extraction matters for SEO

Article images are not just decorative assets. They can affect click-through behavior, content quality, accessibility, and downstream distribution.

Common SEO and content operations include:

- Checking whether article images have useful alt text.
- Verifying whether pages include a primary image or supporting visuals.
- Building image inventories for large editorial sites.
- Detecting missing or broken article media.
- Preparing content previews for internal search or knowledge bases.
- Comparing competitor article media strategy by topic.
- Feeding image URLs into visual review, thumbnail, or archive systems.

If image extraction happens after a full raw HTML crawl, teams often need custom filtering logic to remove logos, icons, and unrelated media. Starting from the readable article area reduces that noise.

}

## SEO workflows you can build

### 1. Alt text quality audit

For each article URL, extract image candidates and check the `alt` field. This lets your team flag pages where article images have missing, generic, or duplicate alt text.

Useful checks include:

- Empty alt text on important article images.
- Alt text that only says "image" or "photo".
- Duplicate alt text across many images.
- Alt text that does not match the article topic.
- Image fields that exist in HTML but are not normalized correctly by the page.

This can become a weekly SEO QA job for content teams that publish at scale.

### 2. Article media inventory

Many editorial teams do not have a reliable inventory of images used in live articles. Extracting article images gives you a structured record of media usage by URL.

Store:

- Article URL
- Image absolute URL
- Alt text
- Width and height
- Extraction timestamp
- Article title from [Article Content Extraction API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontent)

Once the data is stored, you can answer operational questions such as which pages rely on external image hosts, which articles have no images, and which image URLs appear across multiple articles.

### 3. Competitive content review

For competitive SEO, article text is only one part of the page. Image count, image quality, visual explanations, and supporting charts can influence perceived content depth.

You can extract image candidates from competitor articles and compare:

- Number of article images per page.
- Whether images include useful alt text.
- Whether visual assets are unique or reused.
- Whether high-ranking pages include charts, screenshots, diagrams, or product visuals.

The result can help editorial teams decide when a page needs original visuals rather than more text.

### 4. Content preview generation

If you build an internal research tool, CRM enrichment workflow, or knowledge base, you may want to show a representative image beside each saved article. The `images` array provides candidate URLs that your application can score or select.

Selection rules can be simple:

- Prefer images with non-empty alt text.
- Prefer larger dimensions when available.
- Prefer the first high-quality article image.
- Exclude very small icons or decorative images in your own post-processing.

## When to use this API instead of full article extraction

Use [Article Content Extraction API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontent) when you need the full article record: title, description, text, HTML, author, publish time, and images.

Use Extract Images from Article URL API when your workflow is specifically about media:

- Image inventory
- Alt text QA
- Media preview generation
- Image candidate extraction
- Content audit enrichment

If you already call Article Content Extraction and it returns enough image data for your use case, you may not need a second call. If your media workflow is independent, this focused endpoint keeps the payload smaller.

## Implementation notes

- Keep `appkey` on your backend.
- Normalize and deduplicate `absoluteUrl` before storing results.
- Treat `width` and `height` as page attributes when available, not guaranteed measured dimensions.
- Save the source article URL with every image record.
- Recheck important URLs periodically because article images can change after publishing.
- Combine image extraction with article title and publish date for better reporting.
- Build a small review UI for flagged image issues instead of sending raw data directly to editors.

## HTTP status handling

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Article image candidates extracted. | Parse `data.images` and store normalized records. |
| `400` | Missing or invalid URL. | Validate URL format and request body. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Check your `appkey`. |
| `403` | Access or payment issue. | Check subscription and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Rate limit reached. | Reduce concurrency or retry later. |
| `503` | Target page or extraction service unavailable. | Retry later and keep the failed URL for review. |

## FAQ

### Does this return every image on the page?

The API focuses on image candidates from the readable article area. That makes it better for article media workflows than a raw page image scrape.

### Can I use this for image SEO audits?

Yes. The `alt`, `absoluteUrl`, `width`, and `height` fields are useful for finding missing alt text, external media dependencies, and article pages without strong image assets.

### Does it download the images?

No. It returns image URLs and metadata candidates. Your application can decide whether to download, cache, review, or ignore each image.

### How should I combine this with article text?

Use [Article Content Extraction API](https://gugudata.io/details/fetchcontent) to collect article title and body text, then store images as child records under the same source URL.
