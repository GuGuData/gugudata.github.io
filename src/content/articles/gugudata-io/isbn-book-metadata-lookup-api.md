## ISBN Book Metadata Lookup API: Technical Guide and Integration Notes

The ISBN Book Metadata Lookup API from GuGuData helps developers search book metadata by ISBN or title keywords and retrieve title, author, publisher, cover image, and publishing details.

This article is written for developers who want a crawlable, readable reference before integrating the endpoint into a product, data pipeline, internal tool, or technical workflow. The official detail page is [https://gugudata.io/details/isbn](https://gugudata.io/details/isbn).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appkey` | `string` | Yes | `YOUR_APPKEY` | Application key used for request authentication. Supply the value as a query parameter, form field, or multipart field according to the request content type. |
| `isbn` | `string` | No | - | ISBN number for an exact book lookup. |
| `keywords` | `string` | No | - | Book title keywords for fuzzy search. |
| `pageIndex` | `integer` | No | `1` | Page number used for keyword search. |
| `pageSize` | `integer` | No | `10` | Page size used for keyword search. |

  --data-urlencode "pageIndex=1" \
  --data-urlencode "pageSize=10"
```

### Response fields

### Response example

```json
{
  "dataStatus": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "statusDescription": "successfully",
    "responseDateTime": "2026-04-17T00:00:00Z",
    "dataTotalCount": 1,
    "requestParameter": ""
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "Title": "Sample Book",
      "Author": "Sample Author",
      "ISBN": "9780132350884",
      "Publisher": "Sample Publisher",
      "PublisherDateTime": "2026",
      "PageNumber": 320,
      "Binding": "Paperback",
      "BriefIntroduction": "Sample introduction",
      "CoverImage": "https://example.com/cover.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### HTTP status codes

Use the HTTP status code for transport-level handling. If the response body contains `dataStatus.statusCode`, treat it as an application-level status field in the JSON payload.

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Request processed successfully. | Parse the documented response body for the endpoint result. |
| `400` | Invalid request parameters or request format. | Check required fields, data types, and request body format. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Send a valid appkey with the request. |
| `403` | The application key is recognized but access is not allowed. | Check subscription, trial state, and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Request rate or trial usage limit exceeded. | Reduce concurrency or retry after the limit window resets. |
| `500` | Internal service error. | Retry later or contact support if the error persists. |
| `503` | Upstream service unavailable. | Retry later when the dependency is available again. |

### Implementation notes

- Prefer `isbn` for exact lookup and use `keywords` with pagination for discovery workflows.
- Validate that at least one lookup parameter is provided before sending the request.
- Cache stable book metadata when your use case allows it.
- Log the HTTP status code and `dataStatus.statusDescription` together for easier debugging.
- Use the demo endpoint for a quick connectivity check, then switch to the authenticated endpoint for production data.

### FAQ

#### Where is the official API detail page?

The official detail page is [https://gugudata.io/details/isbn](https://gugudata.io/details/isbn). It is the best place to review the latest public endpoint information before publishing or integrating.

#### Should I handle `dataStatus.statusCode` as the HTTP status code?

No. Use the HTTP status code for request-level behavior such as authentication, permission, rate limiting, and server errors. Use `dataStatus.statusCode` only as the response body status field when it is present.

#### Can I use the demo endpoint in production?

No. The demo endpoint is for quick testing and examples. Use the authenticated endpoint with your `appkey` for production workflows.
