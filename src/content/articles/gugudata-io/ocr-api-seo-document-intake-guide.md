Search engines and internal search systems work best when important information exists as text. But many business workflows still depend on screenshots, scanned documents, receipts, labels, forms, notes, and images that contain valuable text. If that text remains inside an image, it is difficult to search, classify, summarize, translate, or connect to downstream automation.

The [GuGuData OCR API](https://gugudata.io/details/ocr) extracts text from an uploaded image file and returns recognized text lines plus a combined full-text result. It is useful for document intake, searchable archives, content operations, and SEO-supporting workflows where image-contained text needs to become structured text.

This guide explains how to call the API, how to process the response, and how OCR fits into broader SEO and content systems.

## Where OCR fits in SEO

OCR is not a replacement for writing accessible HTML content. Important public web content should still be available as text on the page. But OCR is useful around SEO operations in several ways:

- Convert screenshots into searchable notes for content research.
- Extract text from scanned PDFs or image attachments before indexing.
- Build searchable archives for historical documents.
- Process image-only source material before editorial review.
- Capture text from product labels, forms, receipts, or field documents.
- Enrich internal content management systems with text from uploaded images.

For public pages, OCR can help identify whether critical information is trapped inside images and should be converted into HTML text, captions, or accessible content.

## API overview

| Item | Value |

| Main use case | Extract recognized text from an uploaded image file |

The API uses `multipart/form-data` because the source is a file upload.

## Request parameters

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appkey` | `string` | Yes | Your GuGuData application key. Send it as a query parameter. |
| `imagefile` | `file` | Yes | Image file uploaded as multipart form data. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.gugudata.io/v1/imagerecognition/ocr?appkey=REDACTED \
  -F "imagefile=@./sample-image.png"
```

## Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resultText` | `array<string>` | Recognized text lines. |
| `text` | `string` | Full recognized text when available. |

Example response:

```json
{
  "dataStatus": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "statusDescription": "successfully",
    "dataTotalCount": 1
  },
  "data": {
    "resultText": [
      "Quarterly SEO Report",
      "Organic clicks increased by 18 percent",
      "Top opportunity: improve article image alt text"
    ],
    "text": "Quarterly SEO Report\nOrganic clicks increased by 18 percent\nTop opportunity: improve article image alt text"
  }
}
```

## SEO-supporting workflows you can build

### 1. Searchable research archives

SEO research often includes screenshots from search results, competitor pages, reports, dashboards, and ad libraries. OCR can turn those screenshots into text records that your team can search later.

Store:

- Original file name
- Upload time
- Recognized text lines
- Combined text
- Source project or campaign
- Reviewer notes

This turns visual research into a searchable knowledge base instead of a folder of images.

### 2. Image-only content detection

Some pages publish important information as images: event schedules, menus, tables, promotional banners, infographics, or scanned notices. OCR can help content teams audit whether important text is locked inside images.

A simple workflow:

1. Extract article image candidates from a page.
2. Run OCR on selected images.
3. Compare recognized image text with visible HTML page text.
4. Flag pages where important image text is missing from HTML.

This helps improve accessibility, internal search, and SEO quality.

### 3. Document intake before indexing

When users upload screenshots or scanned images to your product, OCR can extract text before you index the record. This is useful for support systems, compliance tools, archives, and workflow automation.

After OCR:

- Store the image file separately from recognized text.
- Index the `text` field for search.
- Keep `resultText` when line breaks matter.
- Review low-quality images manually when extracted text is too short.

### 4. AI summarization and classification

OCR output can be passed into summarization or classification systems. For example, a screenshot of an SEO dashboard can be converted to text, then summarized for a weekly report.

Keep the flow simple:

1. Upload image to OCR API.
2. Review `text`.
3. Send recognized text to a controlled downstream summarization step.
4. Store both the OCR text and generated summary.

## File handling recommendations

Because OCR starts with user-provided files, treat file handling as part of the product design:

- Validate file type before upload.
- Enforce file size limits in your own application.
- Keep credentials server-side.
- Avoid sending sensitive user uploads from browser code with public credentials.
- Keep a clear retention policy for original files and recognized text.
- Store the OCR result with the source file ID so users can trace it.

## When to use related OCR and document APIs

| Need | Recommended API |
| --- | --- |
| Extract text from an image | [OCR API](https://gugudata.io/details/ocr) |
| Generate a Word document from image OCR | [Image OCR to Word API](https://gugudata.io/details/ocr2word) |
| Extract text from a PDF with OCR | [PDF OCR to Text API](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2text) |
| Generate a Word document from PDF OCR | [PDF OCR to Word API](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2word) |
| Parse or convert PDF content | [PDF Parsing and Formatted Output](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2format) |

Use OCR API when you need text as data. Use OCR to Word when the user expects an editable document output.

## HTTP status handling

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Image text extracted. | Store `resultText` and `text`. |
| `400` | Missing or invalid image file. | Validate file type, upload field name, and file size. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Check your `appkey`. |
| `403` | Access or payment issue. | Check subscription and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Rate limit reached. | Reduce concurrency or retry later. |
| `503` | OCR service unavailable. | Retry later and keep the file in a recoverable queue. |

## FAQ

### Does OCR make image text SEO-friendly on a public page?

Not by itself. OCR helps you extract text, but public SEO value usually comes from putting important text into accessible page content, captions, alt text, or structured content.

### Should OCR run in frontend code?

No. Call the API from a backend service so your `appkey`, validation rules, and file handling remain controlled.

### What should I store, lines or full text?

Store both when possible. `resultText` keeps line-level structure, while `text` is easier to index and pass into downstream text processing.

### Can I use OCR for screenshots from SEO tools?

Yes. OCR can convert screenshot text into searchable notes, but always preserve the original screenshot when visual context matters.
