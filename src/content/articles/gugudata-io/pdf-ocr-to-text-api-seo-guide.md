PDF files often contain valuable content that is invisible to search systems, analytics workflows, and internal automation. Some PDFs have selectable text, but many are scanned documents, image-based reports, forms, or exported files where text extraction requires OCR.

The [GuGuData PDF OCR to Text API](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2text) runs OCR on an uploaded PDF document and returns page-level recognized text plus a combined full-text field. It is useful for searchable archives, content operations, compliance review, knowledge bases, and SEO workflows that need document content in text form.

This guide explains how to call the API, how to store the result, and how PDF OCR fits into a practical SEO and document-processing stack.

## Why PDF OCR matters for SEO and content operations

Many organizations publish or store important information in PDFs:

- Product brochures
- Research reports
- White papers
- Press kits
- Menus and schedules
- Legal notices
- Scanned forms
- Historical documents
- Partner materials

If the content remains locked inside a scanned PDF, it is hard to search, summarize, classify, or reuse. PDF OCR turns those documents into text that can power internal search, metadata generation, content audits, and editorial decisions.

For public SEO, the best long-term approach is usually to publish important content as HTML pages. But PDF OCR helps teams understand what is inside existing documents and decide what should be converted, summarized, indexed, or migrated.

## API overview

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| API name | PDF OCR to Text API |
| Method | `POST` |
| Endpoint | `https://api.gugudata.io/v1/imagerecognition/pdf2text` |
| Detail page | [https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2text](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2text) |
| Demo page | [https://gugudata.io/demo/pdf2text](https://gugudata.io/demo/pdf2text) |
| Main use case | Extract OCR text from an uploaded PDF |

The endpoint uses `multipart/form-data` because the source is a PDF upload.

## Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appkey` | `string` | Yes | Your GuGuData application key. Send it as a query parameter. |
| `file` | `file` | Yes | PDF file uploaded as multipart form data. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.gugudata.io/v1/imagerecognition/pdf2text?appkey=REDACTED \
  -F "file=@./sample-document.pdf"
```

## Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resultText` | `array<string>` | Recognized text by page. |
| `text` | `string` | Combined recognized text. |

Example response:

```json
{
  "dataStatus": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "statusDescription": "successfully",
    "dataTotalCount": 1
  },
  "data": {
    "resultText": [
      "Page 1 recognized text...",
      "Page 2 recognized text..."
    ],
    "text": "Page 1 recognized text...\n\nPage 2 recognized text..."
  }
}
```

## SEO and content workflows

### 1. Build searchable PDF archives

If your organization has a large PDF library, OCR output can become the text layer for internal search. The source PDF can remain the original file, while `text` becomes the searchable representation.

Store:

- PDF file ID
- Original file name
- Source URL or upload source
- Page-level recognized text
- Combined text
- OCR timestamp
- Processing status

This makes it possible to search across scanned files that previously had no useful text index.

### 2. Identify PDF content worth converting to HTML

From an SEO perspective, a PDF may be less flexible than a dedicated HTML page. OCR can help teams decide which PDFs deserve conversion.

Useful signals:

- Word count from `text`
- Topic keywords in the document
- Product or service names
- Dates and freshness
- Repeated customer questions
- Existing organic landing behavior if the PDF is public

After OCR, create a shortlist of high-value PDFs that should become HTML landing pages, support articles, or documentation pages.

### 3. Generate metadata for document libraries

Document libraries often suffer from weak titles and descriptions. PDF OCR output can feed metadata generation workflows.

For each PDF:

- Extract `text`.
- Generate a short title suggestion.
- Generate a plain-language description.
- Tag by topic, department, product, or audience.
- Store the generated metadata for human review.

This improves internal discovery and can also support public document landing pages.

### 4. Compliance and content QA

OCR text can be checked for required disclaimers, outdated names, old pricing, missing contact details, or policy language. That makes the API useful for content governance, not just search.

Example checks:

- Does the PDF mention an outdated brand name?
- Does it include a required legal disclaimer?
- Does it include a publication date?
- Does it contain pricing that should be reviewed?
- Is the extracted text too short for the expected document type?

## Page-level vs combined text

The API returns both `resultText` and `text`.

Use `resultText` when:

- Page boundaries matter.
- You need page-level review.
- You want to show search hits with page context.
- The document is long and needs chunking.

Use `text` when:

- You need a single searchable field.
- You want to summarize the whole document.
- You want to classify the document by topic.
- You need simple downstream processing.

Many systems store both. Page-level storage gives you better traceability, and combined text is easier for full-document operations.

## Implementation notes

- Validate that the uploaded file is a PDF before sending it.
- Keep file size and page-count limits in your own application.
- Store the original PDF separately from OCR output.
- Keep OCR jobs idempotent so retries do not create duplicate records.
- Use a queue for large batches.
- Store failed files with a recoverable status.
- Keep `appkey` server-side.
- Do not assume OCR output is perfect. Add review steps for high-stakes documents.

## HTTP status handling

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | PDF text extracted. | Store `resultText` and `text`. |
| `400` | Missing or invalid PDF file. | Validate upload field name, file type, and file size. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Check your `appkey`. |
| `403` | Access or payment issue. | Check subscription and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Rate limit reached. | Reduce concurrency or retry later. |
| `503` | PDF OCR service unavailable. | Retry later and keep the job recoverable. |

## FAQ

### Does this convert the PDF into an editable Word file?

No. This endpoint returns text. Use [PDF OCR to Word API](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2word) when you need a downloadable Word document.

### Should I expose this endpoint directly in browser code?

No. Use your backend so credentials, file validation, retries, and logging are controlled.

### Can I use OCR output for public SEO pages?

Yes, as a source for content migration or metadata generation. For public search visibility, important text should usually be published as accessible HTML.

### What if the PDF already has selectable text?

This API is built for OCR workflows. If you need broader PDF parsing or formatted extraction, also review [PDF Parsing and Formatted Output](https://gugudata.io/details/pdf2format).
