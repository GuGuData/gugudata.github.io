## QR Code and Barcode APIs: Generation, Wi-Fi Access, and Image Decoding

QR codes and barcodes are small integration points that often sit inside larger business workflows. A product may need to generate a payment code, print a logistics label, add Wi-Fi access to onboarding material, or decode QR code images submitted by users.

GuGuData provides APIs for QR code generation, Wi-Fi QR code generation, general barcode generation, and QR code image decoding. This guide explains how these endpoints fit into practical product workflows.

### API lineup

| Workflow | Method | Endpoint | Detail page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QR code generation | `POST` | `/v1/qrcode` | [Universal QR Code Generator](https://gugudata.io/details/qrcode) |
| Wi-Fi QR code generation | `POST` | `/v1/wifi-qrcode` | [Wi-Fi QR Code Generator](https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode) |
| Barcode generation | `POST` | `/v1/barcode` | [General Barcode Generation](https://gugudata.io/details/barcode) |
| QR code image decoding | `POST` | `/v1/barcode/qrcode/decode` | [Decode QR Code from Image](https://gugudata.io/details/qrcode-decode) |

The public OpenAPI JSON is available at [https://gugudata.io/assets/openapi/gugudata.openapi.3.1.json](https://gugudata.io/assets/openapi/gugudata.openapi.3.1.json).

### When to use these APIs

- Generate QR codes for URLs, internal identifiers, invitation links, or operational handoff flows.
- Create Wi-Fi QR codes for offices, hotels, events, or onboarding screens.
- Generate barcodes for product labels, warehouse workflows, or printed forms.
- Decode QR code images uploaded by users or extracted from documents.
- Standardize code generation and decoding logic across multiple services.

### Choosing the right endpoint

Use `/v1/qrcode` when the payload is general text or a URL. Use `/v1/wifi-qrcode` when the payload is a Wi-Fi network configuration and the code should be scannable by common mobile devices.

Use `/v1/barcode` when you need a one-dimensional barcode for product, inventory, or operational labels. Use `/v1/barcode/qrcode/decode` when the input is an image and your application needs the decoded value rather than a generated image.

### Example requests

Generate a QR code:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.gugudata.io/v1/qrcode?appkey=REDACTED \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
{
  "content": "https://www.gugudata.io",
  "size": 200
}
'
```

Decode a QR code image:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.gugudata.io/v1/barcode/qrcode/decode?appkey=REDACTED \
  -F "file=@./qrcode.png"
```

### Response handling

Generation endpoints usually return a URL to the generated image. Decoding returns the parsed payload and detection details:

```json
{
  "dataStatus": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "statusDescription": "successfully",
    "responseDateTime": "2026-04-29T00:00:00Z",
    "dataTotalCount": 1,
    "requestParameter": ""
  },
  "data": {
    "raw": "https://www.gugudata.io",
    "type": "QRCODE",
    "format": "QR_CODE",
    "parsed": ["https://www.gugudata.io"],
    "points": []
  }
}
```

Treat decoded values as user input. Validate URLs, identifiers, and business payloads before using them in privileged workflows.

### HTTP status codes

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Request processed successfully. | Parse the documented response body for the endpoint result. |
| `400` | Invalid request parameters or request format. | Check required fields, uploaded image format, size, and barcode type. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Send a valid `appkey` with the request. |
| `403` | The application key is recognized but access is not allowed. | Check subscription, trial state, and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Request rate or trial usage limit exceeded. | Reduce concurrency or retry after the limit window resets. |
| `500` | Internal service error. | Retry later or contact support if the error persists. |
| `503` | Upstream service unavailable. | Retry later when the dependency is available again. |

### Implementation notes

- Normalize payloads before generating QR codes so duplicate business records do not produce inconsistent codes.
- Use server-side requests when the `appkey` must remain private.
- Validate decoded payloads before redirecting users or writing values into your database.
- Keep image upload size limits explicit for decoding workflows.
- Use demo endpoints for quick checks, then move to authenticated production endpoints.

### FAQ

#### Can I generate Wi-Fi QR codes with the general QR code endpoint?

Use the Wi-Fi QR code endpoint when the payload represents Wi-Fi access. It keeps the request fields clearer and better aligned with Wi-Fi QR code use cases.

#### Should I trust decoded QR code content automatically?

No. Decoded values can contain arbitrary text or URLs. Validate the payload against your product rules before acting on it.

#### Which endpoint should I use for printed product labels?

Use [General Barcode Generation](https://gugudata.io/details/barcode) when the label requires a standard barcode, and use [Universal QR Code Generator](https://gugudata.io/details/qrcode) when the label should carry a URL or flexible text payload.
