## Wi-Fi Wireless Network QR Code Generation API: Technical Guide and Integration Notes

The Wi-Fi Wireless Network QR Code Generation API from GuGuData helps developers generate a Wi-Fi QR code image for wireless network onboarding.

This article is written for developers who want a crawlable, readable reference before integrating the endpoint into a product, data pipeline, internal tool, or technical workflow. The official detail page is [https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode](https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode).

### API details

| API name | Wi-Fi Wireless Network QR Code Generation |
| Category | QR Code and Barcode APIs |
| Method | `POST` |
| Endpoint | `https://api.gugudata.io/v1/wifi-qrcode` |
| Content type | `application/json` |
| Demo endpoint | [https://api.gugudata.io/v1/wifi-qrcode/demo](https://api.gugudata.io/v1/wifi-qrcode/demo) |
| Detail page | [https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode](https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode) |
| OpenAPI JSON | [https://gugudata.io/assets/openapi/gugudata.openapi.3.1.json](https://gugudata.io/assets/openapi/gugudata.openapi.3.1.json) |

### When to use this API

- Generate Wi-Fi onboarding QR codes for offices and venues.
- Reduce manual SSID and password entry.
- Create printable network access cards.

### Request parameters

This endpoint accepts parameters through the query string plus request body. Keep `appkey` out of client-side public code and send it only from trusted server-side environments.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appkey` | `string` | Yes | `YOUR_APPKEY` | Application key used for request authentication. Supply the value as a query parameter, form field, or multipart field according to the request content type. |
| `ssid` | `string` | Yes | - | Wi-Fi network name encoded into the QR code. |
| `password` | `string` | Yes | - | Wi-Fi password encoded into the QR code. |
| `authentication` | `string` | Yes | - | Wi-Fi authentication mode encoded into the QR code. |
| `ishiddenssid` | `string` | Yes | - | Whether the Wi-Fi network is hidden. |
| `isshowwifiicon` | `string` | Yes | - | Whether the generated QR code should include the Wi-Fi icon overlay. |
| `size` | `integer` | No | `500` | A positive integer specifying the pixel size of the QR code, default is 500 pixels |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.gugudata.io/v1/wifi-qrcode?appkey=REDACTED \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
{
  "ssid": "Office WiFi",
  "password": "network-password",
  "authentication": "WPA",
  "ishiddenssid": "false",
  "isshowwifiicon": "true",
  "size": 500
}
'
```

### Response fields

The response body contains the fields below for successful JSON responses. For binary endpoints, the success response is returned as binary content and JSON is used for error responses.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | Yes | CDN URL of the generated Wi-Fi QR code image. Validation failures may return a plain-text error message instead of the success payload. |

### Response example

```json
{
  "dataStatus": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "statusDescription": "successfully",
    "responseDateTime": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z",
    "dataTotalCount": 1
  },
  "data": "sample value"
}
```

### HTTP status codes

Use the HTTP status code for transport-level handling. If the response body contains `dataStatus.statusCode`, treat it as an application-level status field in the JSON payload.

| HTTP status | Meaning | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Request processed successfully. | Parse the documented response body for the endpoint result. |
| `400` | Invalid request parameters or request format. | Check required fields, data types, and request body format. |
| `401` | Missing or unknown application key. | Send a valid appkey with the request. |
| `403` | The application key is recognized but access is not allowed. | Check subscription, trial state, and endpoint access. |
| `429` | Request rate or trial usage limit exceeded. | Reduce concurrency or retry after the limit window resets. |
| `500` | Internal service error. | Retry later or contact support if the error persists. |
| `503` | Upstream service unavailable. | Retry later when the dependency is available again. |

### Implementation notes

- Validate required parameters before sending the request so `400` responses are easier to diagnose.
- Keep server-side retries conservative for `429`, `500`, and `503` responses.
- Cache stable metadata responses when your use case allows it, especially for lookup and directory endpoints.
- Log the HTTP status code and `dataStatus.statusDescription` together for easier debugging.
- Use the demo endpoint for a quick connectivity check, then switch to the authenticated endpoint for production data.

### FAQ

#### Where is the official API detail page?

The official detail page is [https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode](https://gugudata.io/details/wifiqrcode). It is the best place to review the latest public endpoint information before publishing or integrating.

#### Should I handle `dataStatus.statusCode` as the HTTP status code?

No. Use the HTTP status code for request-level behavior such as authentication, permission, rate limiting, and server errors. Use `dataStatus.statusCode` only as the response body status field when it is present.

#### Can I use the demo endpoint in production?

No. The demo endpoint is for quick testing and examples. Use the authenticated endpoint with your `appkey` for production workflows.
